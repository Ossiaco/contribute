# GitHub account setup

## Set up your GitHub account

To contribute to Docs technical content, you need to set up your own GitHub account. The good news is, you usually only have to perform these steps once.

### 1. Create a GitHub account and set up your profile

If you don't already have a GitHub account, [create one](https://github.com/join). Identify any affiliations in your GitHub profile. Contributions to [docs.ossiaco.com](https://docs.ossiaco.com) count toward [MVP award](https://mvp.ossiaco.com) consideration. Identification helps us build a complete profile of all your activities.

>[!NOTE]
> Ossiaco employees participating in Open Source projects always identify themselves as such in their GitHub profiles. Community contributors should ensure that their profile does not incorrectly imply an employment relationship.

## Next step

* Continue to the [Tool installations](get-started-setup-tools.md) article to install Git Bash, a Markdown editor, and more.
